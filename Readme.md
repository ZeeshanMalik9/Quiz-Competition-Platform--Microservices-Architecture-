QuizZee is a modern, scalable, and resilient online quiz and contest platform designed from the ground up using a **microservices architecture**. The platform is engineered to handle everything from small-scale quizzes to large, concurrent competitive events.

This project was born from the personal experience of organizing university events and struggling to find an affordable, flexible quizzing tool. QuizZee aims to solve that problem by providing a powerful, open-source solution for student communities, educators, and organizations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system is designed as a suite of independent, self-contained services that communicate over the network. This approach ensures scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

- **API Gateway**: The single entry point for all client requests. It handles routing, CORS policies, and serves as the first line of security.
- **Eureka Server**: Acts as the service registry, allowing services to dynamically discover and communicate with each other using logical names instead of hardcoded addresses.
- **Core Microservices**: Five distinct services handle the business logic for Users, Questions, Quizzes, Contests, and Submissions. Each service owns its own database.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: Services communicate synchronously using **Spring Cloud OpenFeign**, a declarative REST client that makes cross-service calls feel as simple as local method invocations.

**Sample Request Flow:**

Client App ‚Üí API Gateway (localhost:8765) ‚Üí Eureka Service Discovery ‚Üí Target Microservice (e.g., Contest Service)

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Apache Maven
- MySQL Server
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code

### Steps to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/QuizZee-Microservices.git](https://github.com/your-username/QuizZee-Microservices.git)
    cd QuizZee-Microservices
    ```

2.  **Setup Databases:**
    Ensure your MySQL server is running. Create a separate database schema for each of the five core services: `user_db`, `question_db`, `quiz_db`, `contest_db`, `submission_db`.

3.  **Update Configurations:**
    Navigate into each service's `src/main/resources/application.yml` file and update the `spring.datasource` properties (URL, username, password) to match your local MySQL setup.

4.  **Build All Services:**
    From the root directory of the project, run the Maven wrapper to build all modules:
    ```sh
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```

5.  **Run the Services:**
    You must run the services in the correct order. Open a new terminal for each service.

    * **1. Eureka Server:**
        ```sh
        cd eureka-server
        ./mvnw spring-boot:run
        ```
        Wait for it to start, then check the Eureka dashboard at `http://localhost:8761`.

    * **2. API Gateway:**
        ```sh
        cd api-gateway
        ./mvnw spring-boot:run
        ```

    * **3. Core Services (in any order):**
        Open new terminals and run each of the five core services (`user-service`, `question-service`, etc.) using the same `./mvnw spring-boot:run` command from within their respective directories.

    Once all services are running, you should see them registered on the Eureka dashboard. The application is now accessible through the API Gateway at `http://localhost:8765`.
